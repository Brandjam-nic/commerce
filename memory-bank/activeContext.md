# Active Context

Current Focus:
- Initialize and scaffold the Memory Bank per project rules.
- Capture baseline context for product, system, and tech to support future iterations.

Recent Changes:
- Created memory-bank/ directory files:
  - projectbrief.md
  - productContext.md

Planned Immediate Next Files:
- systemPatterns.md
- techContext.md
- progress.md

Open Decisions:
- Final branding assets (logo, palette, typography).
- Donation/impact model details and messaging.
- Catalog structure and initial collections.
- Shipping/returns/tax policy details.

Short-Term Tasks:
- Fill env variables using .env.example to connect to Shopify.
- Verify Shopify GraphQL operations (lib/shopify) with target store.
- Align homepage and product theming with brand guidelines once available.

Risks & Considerations:
- Any deviation from Vercel Commerce patterns should be documented in systemPatterns.md.
- Performance budgets and Lighthouse targets to be defined.
- Accessibility compliance to be treated as a requirement, not a stretch goal.

Next Steps (Execution List):
1) Create systemPatterns.md with current architecture mapping.
2) Create techContext.md with tooling, scripts, constraints.
3) Create progress.md to track status and milestones.
4) Review .env.example and document required vars in techContext.md.
