      <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

      <h2>Are you a charity?</h2>
      <p>No. Military Resilience Clothing Co is not a charity.</p>

      <h2>How much of the proceeds go to charities or ex-service organisations?</h2>
      <p>
        We support veteran and community causes in line with our vision. Exact mechanisms and beneficiaries
        are communicated transparently when applicable. Our focus is delivering quality apparel at fair prices
        while supporting positive impact where possible.
      </p>

      <h2>Why manufacture in Vietnam?</h2>
      <p>
        Vietnam has a meaningful connection to Australiaâ€™s wartime history. We chose Vietnam for its capable,
        ethical manufacturing and lower production costs, enabling us to provide quality garments at accessible
        prices for customers without compromising standards.
      </p>

      <h2>What sizes do you offer?</h2>
      <p>
        Most apparel ranges from Small to 3XL. A detailed size guide will be published soon. Please review sizing
        information carefully before ordering, as we do not offer change-of-mind or incorrect size returns.
