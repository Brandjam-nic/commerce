      <h2>Vision</h2>
      <p>
        To empower servicemen and women, veterans, families, and supporters
        through thoughtful design and quality garments that reflect values of
        courage, discipline, and unity.
      </p>
      <h2>Manufacturing</h2>
      <p>
        Our products are made in Vietnam. This reflects a practical choice tied
        to Australian wartime history, ethical manufacturing capability, and a
        lower cost base that enables fair pricing for customers without
        compromising quality.
